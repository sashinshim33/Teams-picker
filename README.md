# Overview

This is a simple Team Picker app I made to learn how to connect JavaScript with Firebase. The idea is to add players with names and roles into a cloud database, then have the app randomly split them into balanced teams.  

The main goal was to figure out how to work with Firebase Firestore and use JavaScript to build something that actually works end-to-end.  

Here’s a link to a short demo video showing how it works and explaining the code:

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my code editor, Node.js to run the JavaScript, and Firebase Firestore for the database.  

The code is written in JavaScript with Firebase’s SDK.

 # Acknowledgements

I want to acknowledge that ChatGPT helped me with the .gitignore part of this project. I needed to add it to keep unnecessary files like node_modules/ and .env out of the repository because I was running into errors when trying to push my project to GitHub.
